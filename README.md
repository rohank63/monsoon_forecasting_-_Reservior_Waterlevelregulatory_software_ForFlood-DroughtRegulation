# Monsoon_forecasting_-_Reservior_Waterlevelregulatory_software
**Introduction**
I am ideating a solution to problems flood and drought of Monsoon dependent states of India like Odisha and Chattisgarh  with the application of machine learning for predicting it in advance and consulting prevention step from very beginning.

**Need for the Solution** India's rainfall is completely depends upon the monsoon behaviour. Major nation building process like agricultural primary activity need to predict it in advance to get prepared. Similarly water reservior in India need proper consulatncy with justification for water release in real time to tackel with problem like drought in summer and overflow in rainy season. So those requirement of nation building is creating a big data problem and this need to be solved.  

**Problems and its reason**
* Taking example of Odisha and Chattisgarh
* *Flood in Odisha and Chattisgarh* Is due to unable to predict the monsoon in very advance hence unable to regulate water level of reservior in advance so overflow happens during monsoon that cause flood.  
* *Droughts in Odisha and Chattisgarh* Is due to unable to predict the monsoon in very advance hence unable to regulate water level of reservior in advance that is how much to water to release.

**My solution**_
* I am designing a Machine Learning model using ML tool of Microsoft Azure for supervised learnig and classification statistics, for predictive analysis of rainfall due to monsoon in India in advance.
* Best way to predict the monsoon in advance accurately is to check the various parameter like wind movements in ocean etc, with relating it to the results and effects happens in past years. Feeding the monsoon result and parameter of each days of last couple of years as raw data for supervised study, and feed present parameter data of corresponding day, then using classification ML technique I can predict the monsoon and rainfall to occur as result in advance accurately. This wiil help us greately how much water we should release form reservior in order to create required space so that it does'nt overflow during monsoon and result to flood.
* At the same time predicting the accurate result we can consult Hydrology board and Agricultural board of state to tackel problem like drought. To publish my results i will create a real time functional website as i am skilled in it using HTML, python, javascript, flask, django and deploy it to Microsoft Azure.
