# monsoon_forecasting_-_Reservior_Waterlevelregulatory_software
**Introduction.**
I am ideating a solution to flood during rainy season and drought during summer seaon problem in odisha and chattisgarh with the application of machine learning for predictive analysis in vary advance.

**Problems and its reason.**

*Flood in Odisha and Chattisgarh*_ Unable to predict the monsoon in vary advance hence unable to regulate water level of reservior in advance so overflow during monsoon that cause flood.  
*Droughts in Odisha and Chattisgarh*_ Unable to predict the monsoon in vary advance hence unable to regulate water level of reservior in advance how much to release water.

**My solution**_I am designinga ML model for supervised learnig and classification statistics. Best way to predict the monsoon in advance accurately is to check the various parameter like wind movements in ocean etc with relating it to the results anad affects happens in past years. feeding the monsoon result and parameter of each days of last couple of years as raw data for machine learning and present data with the classification ML technique using supervised learning I can predict the monsoon whenever required accurately. This wiil help us greately how much water we should release form reservior in order to create required space so that it does'nt overflow during monsoon.
at the same time getting propere water release notificaton in summer can abolish drought like problems.

**Social Impact** solution to drought and Flood in moonsoon dependent or affected areas like odisha, chattisgarh and jharkahnd.
