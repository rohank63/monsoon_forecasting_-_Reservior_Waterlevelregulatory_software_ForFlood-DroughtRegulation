# monsoon_forecasting_-_Reservior_Waterlevelregulatory_software
**Introduction.**
I am ideating a solution to problems flood during rainy season and drought during summer seaon in Odisha and Chattisgarh state of India with the application of machine learning for predictive analysis in very advance.

**Need for the Solution** For many years there is conflicts arising between Chattisgarh and Odisha state Hydrology board, because for no proper prier decision Chattisgarh reservior does'nt release proper water during summer the reason for drought in Odisha. And during monsoon their reservior overflows due to non released water of summer, the main reason of flood in Odisha because river flows from Chhatisgarh to Odisha heading toward bay of bengal. We can clearly see that both need a consultancy platform to predict and regulate the behaviour of monsoon rainfall and reservior water consecutively, which can be solved accurately with the appplication of machine learning solving this big DATA problem.

**Problems and its reason.**

*Flood in Odisha and Chattisgarh*_ Is due to unable to predict the monsoon in very advance hence unable to regulate water level of reservior in advance so overflow happens during monsoon that cause flood.  
*Droughts in Odisha and Chattisgarh*_ Is due to unable to predict the monsoon in very advance hence unable to regulate water level of reservior in advance that is how much to water to release.

**My solution**_I am designinga a ML model using ML tool of Microsoft Azure for supervised learnig and classification statistics, for predictinve analysis of rainfall due to monsoon in India in advance. Best way to predict the monsoon in advance accurately is to check the various parameter like wind movements in ocean etc, with relating it to the results and effects happens in past years. Feeding the monsoon result and parameter of each days of last couple of years as raw data for supervised study and feed present parameter data of corresponding day, then using classification ML technique I can predict the monsoon and rainfall to occur in advance accurately. This wiil help us greately how much water we should release form reservior in order to create required space so that it does'nt overflow during monsoon.
at the same time getting propere water release notificaton in summer can abolish drought like problems. to publish my results i will create a real time functional website as i am skilled in it using HTML, python, javascript and deploy it to Microsoft Azure.

**Social Impact** (1)solution to drought and Flood in moonsoon dependent or affected areas like odisha, chattisgarh and jharkahnd.

**Getting Started/Prerequisite**_(1)HTML, (2)Nde.js, (3)Javascript and python language skill, (4)ML Prerequuisites(https://www.quora.com/What-are-prerequisites-to-start-learning-machine-learning)
